Problem with current mapping:
	
	1. The mirror places
	2. When we test the turtlebot in the corridor, it often goes offline(teleop and laser data streaming)
	3. The rotation speed should be slow to map correctly. (less than 1.5 in teleop should be safe)


TODO:
	Continue to test gmapping and mapping with kinect, tune them and pick the one that perform best.
	Frontier exploration
