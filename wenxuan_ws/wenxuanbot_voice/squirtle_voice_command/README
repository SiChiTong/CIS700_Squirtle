Here is document of Demo_voice_command node

THis node as a whole is a Finite-State-Machine with states listed below
1. Busy   -- means the robot is currently busy at other task
             when busy, it can response(only) to summoning phrase and flip state to "wait for command"
             if it was assigned new task it will ask if it should cancel current one
2. Free   -- means the robot is not doing anything
             when free it can response(only) to summoning phrase and flip state to "wait for command"         
3. Wait for command (wfc)
          -- means the robot is summoned, it will listen for command
             when wait for command, if the command is not recognizable
             state will return back to previous state(busy or free)  
4. mimic  -- means the robot is in mimic state which is a debugging state
             in this state it will say anything it hears
             terminate if it hears mimic mode termination phrase


For voice command it has four different levels of recognition (from loose to strict)
1. Contains -- will recognize if the desired phrases is contained in input phrase
2. Exact    -- Will recognize only if the input phrase is exactly the same as desired one
3. Ask for confirmation
            -- will ask for confirmation once recognized, for safety
4. Refuse   -- refuse such command and give a reason 

A state transfer graph is also provided in this folder.
