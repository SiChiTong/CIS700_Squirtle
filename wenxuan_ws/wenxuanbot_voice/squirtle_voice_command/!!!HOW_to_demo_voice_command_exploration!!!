This tutorial with teach you how to run the voice command with localization and exploration
relavent file:   demo_squirtle_command_with_localization_exploration.launch


Dependencies:
	This demo needs pretty much everything:
	turtlebot_bringup
	sound_play
	squirtle_voice_localization
	pocket_sphinx
	hokuyo_node
	hector_mapping
	move_base
	hector_exploration_node
	squirtle_frontier_exploration
	squirtle_mouth

	In addtion, hardware requirment:
	voice localization arduino kit for squirtle (arduino port is by default at /dev/ttyACM0)
	hokuyo lidar (udev setup needed,please see its package)
	turtlebot

	(of course you don't need to bringup all of them, some of them is loaded dynamically)


Steps:
	0.Be sure to plug in arduino first and then hokuyo, to make sure arduino is at /dev/ttyACM0

	1.bring up turtlebot:
		$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
	2.bring up demo file:
		$ roslaunch squirtle_voice_command demo_squirtle_command_with_localization_exploration.launch


	Now it will enter voice command mode, and "begin exploration" is available
