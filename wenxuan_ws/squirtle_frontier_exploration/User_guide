Overview:
  -->This package is for frontier exploration of squirtle.
     Using the frontier exploration package provide by hector navigation.

  -->Mechanism of this package:
     --> Use hector_exploration_node which:
         subscibe to: /tf (/base_link frame to /map frame), 
                      /map (usually provided by /map_server when doing amcl, or by gmapping or hector_mapping node)
         publish to:  /exploration_path (which specify the trajectory of exploration)
         provided service: /get_exploration_path (when call will return the path, also publish it to /exploration_path)
         
     --> simple_exploration node to manage exploration.
         require: 
            move_base,  /get_exploration_path service
         includes:
            service client: call /get_exploration_path 
            move_base action client: send goal to and get status from move_base
         process:       
            call /get_exploration_path service and get the path.
            extract the last pose as the exploration goal, pass it to move_base 
              (NOTE: instead of using the path_follower provided by hector_navigation, this will give flexibility from move_base)
            check the status of move_base and adjust behavior

Usage:
  <Simple usage on a standard turtlebot>: 
      (DESCRIPTION: this is for turtlebot2 with kinect default setup)
      (NOTE: hasn't been optimized so the performance maybe ugly. It's just for a quick on-hand)

      1. (On turtlebot) fireup bringup
          $ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

      2. (On turtlebot) start gmapping demo, this will bring up gmapping and move_base
          $ roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch

      3. (On turtlebot) start hector exploration planner, this will provide exploration plan service
          $ roslaunch hector_exploration_node exploration_planner.launch

      4. (On remote or turtlebot) start simple exploration node
          $ rosrun squirtle_frontier_exploration simple_exploration 

      Now the turtlebot will start moving to exploration goals

  <Usage on squirtle>
      (DESCRIPTION: this is for turtlebot2 with rplidar)
