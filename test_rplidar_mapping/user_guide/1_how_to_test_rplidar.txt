1. Installation
	copy the folder "rplidar_ros" into your ~/catkin_ws/src folder and do catkin_make to build. (rplidar_ros is from https://github.com/robopeak/rplidar_ros)

2. Connect the rplidar to usb, the motor should be spinning now. 

3. Change the permission of rplidar port by: 
	$sudo chmod 0666 /dev/ttyUSB*
	or 
	you can achieve this by adding udev rule "KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", MODE="0666"" to /etc/udev/rules.d/ 

	note: by default the rplidar launch file gets data from ttyUSB0 port(you can change it in rplidar_ros/launch/rplidar.launch file)

4. Run rplidar launch file. 
	$roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch

5. Set up rviz.
	open another terminal and run:
	$rosrun rviz rviz
	set global fixed frame to "laser" (by default rplidar sets frame id to "laser", you can change it in rplidar_ros/launch/rplidar.launch)
	add Laserscan and set its topic to /scan (in which rplidar publishes lidar data)
	now you can visualize ridar data in rviz



NOTE: this guide provides raw steps to help you understand whats going on in each step. 
	A intergrated launch file will be provided later.
