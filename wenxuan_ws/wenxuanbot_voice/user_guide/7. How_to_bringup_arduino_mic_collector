arduino mic collector is a arduino device collect microphone "strength" of three microphones
This tutorial will show you how to bring it up with ROS



1. Setup arduino IDE as introduced before. 
    Also, check the port your Arduino connects. (mine is /dev/ttyACM0)

2. Burn "mic_array_collector.ino" into your Arduino
    in "mic_array_collector.ino" you may want to set several parameters:
        PORT_MIC_X,PORT_MIC_Y,PORT_MIC_Z, by default they are A0 A1 A2
        FILTER_THIS, FILTER_LAST, by default 0.1 0.9 (good enough)
        interval_pub_ms, by default 500, it means it publishes data to ROS every 500ms

3. Launch it! 
    $ roslaunch squirtle_voice_localization arduino_collector_bringup.launch port:="/dev/ttyACM0"
    And it will start publishing data!!!! 



Publishes:
    Topic "/arduino_collector/mic_array_strength" ("~mic_array_strength")
        which has type "geometry_msgs/Vector3" (we did not use stamped msg due to memory limitations)
            Vector3.x is microphone x strength value
            Vector3.y is microphone y strength value
            Vector3.z is microphone z strength value
