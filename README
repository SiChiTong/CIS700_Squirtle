This README contains the basc instructions for testing out the capabilities of squirtle. Last updated Dec 16 2015

--------------Terminal Commands to run Demos------------------ 
Running Task Demo - 
roslaunch squirtle_bringup squirtle_bringup_task_list.launch 

Running Arm Demo -
roslaunch squirtle_arm squirtle_arm_demo.launch

Running Tabletop Detector - 
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch 
rosrun opencv_files tabletop_detector 



-------------Some Debug and shortcut tips--------------------
For speech tasks -
To simulate the button actions - 
New window - rostopic pubpub -r 5 /nexusMessage std_msgs/String button_not_pressed (It should keep shouting now) ctrl+C
rostopic pubpub -r 5 /nexusMessage std_msgs/String button_pressed (It should stop shouting, and move on to the next task)

------------File Descriptions-------------------

--classification_stuff--
This folder contains files related to classification. It includes the Caffe files for Caffe: an open source Convolutional Neural Network.

svm_example.py
a simple example file demonstrating the appropriate calls for using an SVM in python

classify.py 
an out-of-the-box image classifer callable from the command line.
By default it configures and runs the Caffe reference ImageNet model. 

tryTrain1.py
Model that uses caffe as a feature extractor and uses an SVM model for training

workingTest.py
Takes in an image as an argument, and uses caffe as a feature extractor and classifies the image through the trained svm classifier. 

--downloader--
this folder contains a script for downloading images

image_grabber.py
uses google api to download images from the internet


--opencv_files--
this folder contains several vision codes

face_node.cpp
a face detector using haar cascade templates 

object_detector.cpp
an object detector using sift features

tabletop_node.cpp
a kinect based object detector that extracts the principle plane using RANSAC and clusters points that sit above the plane.

--squirtle_bringup--
this folder contains launch files for some of our demos

squirtle_bringup_task_list.launch
runs our tasklist demo. This executes a sequence of tasks including finding a person, navigating, and retrieving a soda can.

squirtle_bringup_voice_command.launch
runs a one shot task demo. Squirtle receives a voice command, carries out the specified task, and awaits the next command.

--squirtle_object_detection--
obj_detection_status.py
uses the tabletop detector and SVM to classify an object

--squirtle_utils--
listen_talk.py
a sample publisher/subscriber implemented in python

tasklist.py
node that maintains the tasklist for our tasklist demo

robotStateNode.py
node that monitors the state of the robot. This node is the finite state machine of the robot that interfaces with the tasklist and the various subroutines.

--squirtle_navigation--
destinationPoint.py
node tosend action service to move_base to move the robot to the location

myPose.py
node that subscribes to amcl_pose and keeps track of the robot's location in the map frame

subroutineStatus.py
node that checks the status of the navigation task and commnicates with the robotStateNode about the status of the navigation task

--squirtle_nexus--
BTreceiver.py
node to connect an Android device to NUC (refer to website)

--squirtle_Android--
Android app for Squirtle

--squirtle_arm--
squirtle_arm_demo.launch
Launch file to run squirtle flower pick and place demo

squirtle_arm_bringup.launch
launch file to initialize the manipulator (refer to website for setup details)

arm_arduino
folder with arduino files for arm

--squirtle_arm_kinematics--
arm_Planning.py
node to make manipulator got to a specific point

sendArmPose.py
publisher to send a target point to manipulator

squirtle_FlowerGreeting.py
Squirtle flower pick and place demo

squirtleShakeHand.py
squirtle Shake hand demo
