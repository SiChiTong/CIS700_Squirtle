This is a tutorial of how to use the demo code in package squirtle_voice_command

this demo is basically showing the architecture and how it accept commands execute tasks.
You can command it: go forward backward(just to represent short task), turn left right(just to present longer task and how it handles task when busy).

Implementation of navigation tasks or other hard tasks can also be integrated in this code, it only needs to 
    1. Have a handle to start the task. (e.g. a move_base client to set the goal)
    2. Have a indication of finish. (e.g. or something to wait for finishing,like ac.waitForResult())
    --> just put them inside the Action_thread class in the demo file like: start->wait->finish->return as it's a thread

Here are steps of execute the demo:

1. Plug-in your microphone, and set it to input!

2. Enter command line: 
    $ roslaunch squirtle_voice_command demo_squirtle_command.launch

3. When you hear robot saying "sound initialize complete", it means it's ready to go!
    Use command "squirtle" or "turtlebot" to activate it first, and something like "go forward" to command it, for details you can check the state switcher in the file demo_voice_command.py.

NOTE: this demo has dependencies on pocketsphinx and sound_play package, it also uses an additional voice pack called "cmu_us_rms_arctic", if you did not installed that you can either: comment and uncomment out corresponding lines of using voice, install the voice pack by following tutorial 3
