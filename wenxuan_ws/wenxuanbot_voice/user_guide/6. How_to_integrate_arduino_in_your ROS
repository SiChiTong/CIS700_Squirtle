This tutorial will guide you how to use arduino with your ROS application by construct a "hello world" function
The voice localization is using arduino to collect sound.

Mechanism:
    The main idea is that the arduino serves as a ros node, it can publish, subscribe just like other nodes. It connects with computer using USB, and the package rosserial will forward the serial data from arduino to your ROS.

Here are steps:
    
    1. Install rosserial package
        $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial-arduino
        $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial

    2. Install arduino IDE on website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.
        For the linux version it gives you a zip file, unzip it, put it on your ~/Desktop (or somewhere else). And it should work out of the box by executing:
        $ cd <dir of your arduino folder>
        $ ./arduino 

    3. Set arduino library to include ros_lib.
        Arduino is using a concept "sketchbook" to store your libraries and code. And it need to include ros libraries to write ros compatible code.
        First, set file->preferences->sketchbook location to put the sketchbook anywhere you like (I just put it on my ~/Desktop).
        Second, cd into your sketchbook/libraries, then :
            $ rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .
        This should copy the libraries ros_lib into the sketchbook
        Finally, openup arduino IDE, goto file->examples if you see "ros_lib" listed, it means you succeed!

    4. Hello World program (loved by everbody):
        1. Open the file->example->ros_lib->hello world, that's the code you will upload to arduino.
        2. Plug-in your arduino, check its port (mine is at /dev/ttyACM0), you may need to open its permission by: (or you may failed to upload)
            $ chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM0
        3. Set the port in IDE, and upload!
        4. run :
            $ roscore
            $ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0 (the forwarding node)
        NOW look into topic "chatter" you can see the hello world!!!! (excited, isn't it!?)
