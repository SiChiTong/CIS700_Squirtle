-->This package is for frontier exploration of squirtle.
   Using the frontier exploration package provide by hector navigation.

-->Mechanism of this package:
   --> Use hector_exploration_node which:
       subscibe to: /tf (/base_link frame to /map frame), 
                    /map (usually provided by /map_server when doing amcl, or by gmapping or hector_mapping node)
       publish to:  /exploration_path (which specify the trajectory of exploration)
       provided service: /get_exploration_path (when call will return the path, also publish it to /exploration_path)
       
   --> another node to manage exploration.
       subscribe to: /move_base/status
       publish to:   /move_base_simple/goal
                     /move_base/cancel
       
       service client: call /get_exploration_path 
       service server: provide  /start_exploration
                                /pause_exploration
                                
       call /get_exploration_path service and get the path.
       extract the last pose as the exploration goal, pass it to move_base 
        (NOTE: instead of using the path_follower provided by hector_navigation, this will give flexibility from move_base)
       check the status of move_base and adjust behavior
