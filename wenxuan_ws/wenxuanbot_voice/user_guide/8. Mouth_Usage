Squirtle_mouth is a package that depends on sound_play

It's basically listen to topic "string_to_say" and say whatever there is

So that multiple nodes can use this same pronouncing device i.e. the "Mouth"


Usage of Squirtle Mouth is pretty simple:
    1. Bring up Mouth!
       $ roslaunch squirtle_mouth squirtle_mouth_bringup.launch
    2. Try Mouth!
       Just publish a string to topic /mouth/string_to_say
       $ rostopic pub -1 /mouth/string_to_say std_msgs/String "greetings human, my name is squirtle"
       (of course you may want to publish it in your code rather than command line!)

Enjoy it!
