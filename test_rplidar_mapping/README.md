# test_rplidar_mapping
rplidar mapping testing code and user guide

Some step-by-step user guides can be found in "user_guide" directory

!!NOTE!!: before you do anything to rplidar, run the bash script:
$ sudo bash setup_rplidar.bash
This will set the rplidar rules, create symlink "rplidar" and chmod to "0666", otherwise rplidar.launch won't work
